Though I'm not religious, I love the apophatic tradition and especially love reading Eckhart's works.
Blessed are those who preach of the ineffable.
Some of my favourite Meister Eckhart quotes:

> “One must not always think so much about what one should do, but rather what one should be. Our works do not ennoble us; but we must ennoble our works.”

> “If the only prayer you ever say in your whole life is "thank you," it will be enough.”

> “Only the hand that erases can write the true thing.”

> “Truth is something so noble that if God could turn aside from it, I could keep the truth and let God go.”

> “Even now one rarely hear of people achieving great things unless they first stumble in some respect.”

> “For the person who has learned to let go and let be, nothing can ever get in the way again.”
