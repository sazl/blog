I'm having a lot of trouble connecting Ableton to my Ableton Link enabled apps.
I first looked into the Windows Firewall, sure enough, Ableton's ports were blocked.
Enabling them didn't fix the issue.
I then checked my router's firewall, looked good, multicast was enabled.

Next, let's look at what Ableton is actually sending. Is it even sending anything?
