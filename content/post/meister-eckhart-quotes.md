Though I'm not religious, I love the apophatic tradition and especially love reading Eckhart's works.

Blessed are those who preach of the ineffable.

Some of my favourite Meister Eckhart quotes:

> One must not always think so much about what one should do, but rather what one should be. Our works do not ennoble us; but we must ennoble our works.

> Be willing to be a beginner every single morning.

> If the only prayer you ever say in your whole life is "thank you," it will be enough.

> Only the hand that erases can write the true thing.

> Truth is something so noble that if God could turn aside from it, I could keep the truth and let God go.

> Even now one rarely hear of people achieving great things unless they first stumble in some respect.

> For the person who has learned to let go and let be, nothing can ever get in the way again.

> Wisdom consists in doing the next thing you have to do, doing it with your whole heart, and finding delight in doing it

> God, who is faithful, allows his friends to fall frequently into weakness only in order to remove from them any prop on which they might lean. For a loving person it would be a great joy
> to be able to achieve many great feats, whether keeping vigils, fasting, performing other ascetical practices or doing major, difficult and unusual works. For them this is a great joy,
> support and source of hope so that their works become a product and a support upon which they can lean. But it is precisely this which our Lord wishes to take from them so that he alone
> will be their help and support . . . in no way do our works serve to make God give us anything or do anything for us. Our Lord wishes his friends to be freed from such an attitude, and
> thus he removes their support from them so that they must henceforth find their support only in him.

Can't escape the feeling that Eckhart repackages eastern mysticism in a catholic shell.
